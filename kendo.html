            <p>Kendo (剣道), meaning "The Way of the Sword," is a modern Japanese martial art that originated from the techniques of samurai swordsmanship, known as Kenjutsu. Practitioners of Kendo, called kendoka, use bamboo swords called shinai and wear protective armor known as bogu. Kendo is not only a physical practice but a method of disciplining the human character through the principles of the samurai.</p>

            <h2>History of Kendo</h2>
            <div class="div-block">
                <p>
                Kendo traces its origins to the fighting techniques of the samurai, who practiced Kenjutsu for centuries. After the decline of the samurai class in the 19th century, Kendo evolved as a way to preserve traditional swordsmanship while adapting it to modern times. By the early 20th century, Kendo became formalized into the martial art we know today, with structured training methods and competitions. It remains a popular martial art worldwide, with strong emphasis on respect, discipline, and mental focus.

            <h2>Philosophy and Goals of Kendo</h2>
            <div class="div-block reverse">
                <p>
Kendo is more than just learning to wield a sword. It encompasses a deeper philosophy, teaching discipline, respect for others, and continuous self-improvement. The ultimate goal of Kendo is to forge the mind and body, developing qualities such as endurance, integrity, and humility. Practitioners strive for Ki Ken Tai Icchi (気剣体一致), meaning "spirit, sword, and body as one," where the correct strike results from uniting one’s mental focus, physical technique, and posture.

                <p>This equipment allows for full-speed practice while maintaining safety and encouraging real combat techniques.</p>
            </details>
            <h2>Basic Techniques and Movements</h2>
            <p>In Kendo, there are four main target areas for strikes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Men: A strike to the head.</li>
                <li>Kote: A strike to the wrist.</li>
                <li>Do: A strike to the torso.</li>
                <li>Tsuki: A thrust to the throat.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The basic stance in Kendo is called Chudan-no-kamae (middle guard), where the shinai is held in front of the body. Footwork is also crucial, and Suri-ashi (sliding step) is the primary method of movement, allowing quick, fluid motions during combat.</p>
            <h2>Kendo in Modern Times</h2>
            <p>Today, Kendo is practiced by millions of people worldwide. It is especially popular in Japan, where it is part of school physical education programs and remains a significant cultural tradition. Major organizations such as the All Japan Kendo Federation (AJKF) and the International Kendo Federation (FIK) govern the rules and competitions globally. Prestigious events like the All Japan Kendo Championship and the World Kendo Championship showcase the highest levels of Kendo skill and spirit.</p>
