          <h3>About Iaido</h3>
          <p>
            Iaido (居合道) is the art of drawing a Japanese sword from its
            scabbard to obtain advantage over an opponent. The sword is drawn to
            defend one's self, to exert control or perform the required actions
            to save one's own life in the most efficient way.
          </p>

          <h3>History of Iaido</h3>
          <p>
            The origins of the martial arts lie hidden in Japan’s early history.
            The first Japanese swords date back to the Yayoi period around 200
            BC. They still had straight blades and were probably modelled on
            Chinese weapons. The first typical Japanese swords with curved
            blades were not made until the Hakuho period around 700 AD.
          </p>
          <p>
            Techniques for the correct wielding of the sword already existed in
            the Nara period (710-784).
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Kamakura period (1185-1333), swords and the arts of swordplay
            had their heyday due to the political situation in civil war-torn,
            feudal Japan. Many different schools emerged that developed their
            own systems of martial arts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Among the oldest known styles of martial arts are Nen Ryu in 1368
            and Katori Shinto Ryu in 1450. The sword fighting systems contained
            therein, which primarily served to prepare warriors for the various
            situations in the long-lasting warlike conflicts, formed the basis
            on which various iaido styles could develop.
          </p>
          <p>
            The basic aim of these iaido systems was, on the one hand, to avoid
            tiring conflicts by attacking immediately and, on the other hand, to
            be able to counter sudden attacks effectively.

          <h3>Equipment</h3>
          <p>
            Originally, Iaido was trained with katanas – the extremely sharp
            Japanese swords. In order to prevent possible injuries, today Iaido
            is usually trained with Iaitos – blunt training swords made of a
            special metal alloy that are modelled on katanas. These should be
            adapted to the height and arm length of the trainee. Beginners‘
            training begins with a bokuto or bokken – a wooden sword modelled on
            the katana that is also used for partner exercises – to familiarise
            the practitioner with the basic positions and movements. Very
            advanced practitioners may also use sharp swords.

          <h3>Stages in training</h3>
          <ol class="stages-in-training">
            <li>
              Keiko. This means quite simply training or practice. This is the
              stage during which the essential movements are perfected by slow
              repetition, by breaking the kata down into its component parts, by
              understanding how the techniques work in a fighting situation.
              With this practice the swordsman begins to understand the
              principles of Metsuke (correct use of the eyes), Seme (pressing or
              pushing) in order to control the opponent, of Maai (combative
              distance) and Ma (timing). This study takes about five years of
              regular practice. Overlapping with it, from about the third or
              fourth year, the swordsman will begin the practice of Tanren.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tanren means to forge in the same way that a sword blade is
              forged, with hard work, and sweat, and many hours of dedication,
              folding together the hard and soft elements in the body, mind, and
              movement just as the sword gains its strength out of hard and soft
              steel. The student increasingly practises without concern for the
              correctness of the movements (though they must remain correct and
              effective) and repeats the kata uninterrupted with a feeling of
              Shinken Shobu (a fight to the death with a real sword). During
              this phase posture improved, movements become more natural,
              techniques become more effective because timing is better
              controlled and less predictable. As confidence increases and
              Kigurai (bearing, demeanour) develops, training moves into the
              phase called Renshu.
            </li>
            <li>
              Renshu. Ren means to polish, to perfect by continued practice of
              both keiko and tanren. It also means to polish the spirit and
              character through the requirements of detail and interpretation.
              To demonstrate a compassionate nature that can pass on knowledge
              without egotistical pride and arrogance. This leads to the award
              of Renshi meaning a person whose performance and character is
              polished by training. This grade is not awarded below the rank of
              6th Dan and is only available from the All Japan Kendo Federation
              (ZNKR). After this stage the actions become slower and softer,
              appearing to a bystander to be less effective-but the technique
              comes from refined efficiency, not using force-until the moment
              the sword is actually cutting, remaining relaxed in body but
              constantly aware and prepared in mind. Only after leaving all of
              these stages in the past and demonstrating the simplicity of the
              correct action and knowing all of these stages by direct
              experience can the student who has by now gained 7th Dan receive
              Kyoshi (teacher grade) from the ZNKR.
